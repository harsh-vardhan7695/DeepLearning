        "Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\n",

        "Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\n",

        "Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\n",
        "Joey: Instead of...?\n",
        "Chandler: That's right.\n",
        "Joey: Never had that dream.\n",
        "Phoebe: No.\n",
        "Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\n",
        "Monica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\n",
        "Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\n",

        "Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?\n",
        "Ross: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\n",
        "Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what? A wrong number?\n",
        "Ross: Sorry.\n",
        "Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\n",

        "Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?\n",
        "Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\n",

        "Ross: Hi.\n",

        "Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\n",
        "Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\n",
        "Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n",

        "Phoebe: If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\n",
        "Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\n",
        "Joey: I say push her down the stairs.\n",

        "(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)\n",
        "Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\n",
        "Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.\n",
        "Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\n",
        "Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\n",
        "Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\n",

        "Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\n",
        "Phoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...\n",
        "Rachel: I'm all better now.\n",
        "Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!\n",
        "Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.\n",
        "Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\n",

        "Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\n",
        "Phoebe: What does that mean?  Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)\n",
        "(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)\n",
        "Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\n",

        "Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\n",
        "Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it.\n",
        "Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.\n",

Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.

Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!\n",
        "Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\n",
        "Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you!
